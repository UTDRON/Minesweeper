Minesweeper Game. Undergrad project as part of requirements for Object Oriented Programming Course.
Developed with C++ and SDL library.

It was developed wayyyyyy back in 2014 during my sophomore year. I found the source code reently while searching through some backup files in my USB hard drive. So, I thought why not keep it in my github repo.
